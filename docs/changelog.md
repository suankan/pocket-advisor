## 2026-07-18 — Envelope-enriched payload + message-artifact consolidation

Implementation commit: `a48bf7b`.

- Consolidated each email cache to write-verified
  `email_message_full.txt` and `email_message.txt` artifacts.
- Made the authored body region of `email_message.txt` the email leaf-chunk
  source, with envelope-relative offsets and pure evidentiary `chunks.text`.
- Added source-aware email, attachment, and native-document retrieval payloads
  shared identically by dense embedding and `chunks_fts.payload_shadow`.
- Added the `envelope-v1` payload recipe to the embedding fingerprint so a
  recipe change selects a new vector cache without re-chunking.
- Added fresh-schema refusal for pre-payload chunk/FTS layouts and fixture
  coverage for payload derivation, FTS envelope hits, fingerprint separation,
  pure snippets, offsets, and the final two-artifact cache.

Verification: native module tests 8/8; frozen tests 11/11; `git diff --check`
clean. No live corpus or derived state was touched.

Deferred: measure enriched versus plain payload retrieval after the native
accuracy runner is ported; adoption of the enriched recipe is already locked.
